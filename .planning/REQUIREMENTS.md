### Session Metrics
- [x] **METRICS-01**: System can provide basic session metrics (e.g., session length).

## v2 Requirements (Deferred Features)

These features are planned for subsequent releases after the v1 product is established.

### Data Extraction & Tracking
- [ ] **DATA-01**: System can extract and track entities (e.g., characters, locations, items) across sessions.

### Search
- [ ] **SEARCH-02**: User can perform semantic searches within session data.

### Customization
- [ ] **CUSTOM-01**: User can customize parameters for summarization and recaps.

### Plot Identification
- [ ] **PLOT-01**: System can identify potential plot hooks and loose ends within sessions.

## Out of Scope

The following features are explicitly not planned for this project:

-   **Dice roll tracking and analysis:** Not a core focus for narrative review.
-   **Full Virtual Tabletop (VTT) functionality:** Focus remains on post-session analysis, not live gameplay platform.
-   **Over-reliance on manual tagging/categorization:** System aims for AI-driven automation.
-   **Real-time transcription:** Prioritizes accuracy over immediate transcription during live sessions.
-   **Complex social networking features:** Project is a utility for GMs, not a social platform.
