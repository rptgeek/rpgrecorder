# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-05
**Phases:** 1-3
**Total Plans:** 22

## Overview

The v1.0 milestone delivers the core functionality for TTRPG session recording, transcription, AI summarization, and player engagement. It establishes the foundation for session management, integrates AWS Transcribe for automatic transcription with speaker diarization, implements AI-powered summarization using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and provides player-specific recaps with export and sharing capabilities.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation - Recording & Transcription

**Goal**: Users can securely manage their game sessions and accurately capture/transcribe audio content.

**Depends on**: None

**Plans**: 14 plans

Plans:

- [x] 1-01: Database & Prisma Setup
- [x] 1-02: Auth.js Integration
- [x] 1-03: Session Management API
- [x] 1-04: AWS S3 Presigned URL API
- [x] 1-05: Client-side Audio Recording & S3 Upload UI
- [x] 1-06: AWS Transcribe Integration & Data Storage
- [x] 1-07: Session View UI & Basic Transcript Display
- [x] 1-08: Synchronized Transcript Playback
- [x] 1-09: Basic Manual Notes Feature
- [x] 1-10: Auth UI & Middleware
- [x] 1-11: Presigned URL API
- [x] 1-12: Session CRUD APIs
- [x] 1-13: Audio Upload UI
- [x] 1-14: Transcribe Trigger & Webhook

**Details:**

Phase 1 established the foundational data layer with Prisma and PostgreSQL, implemented secure authentication using Auth.js with middleware-based route protection, created complete session CRUD operations, integrated AWS S3 for audio storage with presigned URLs, implemented client-side audio recording, integrated AWS Transcribe for automatic transcription with speaker diarization, built synchronized transcript playback UI, and added basic manual notes functionality.

Key technical decisions included using AWS RDS PostgreSQL for the database, Auth.js for authentication, AWS S3 for audio storage, and AWS Transcribe for transcription services.

### Phase 2: Core Value - AI Summarization & Search

**Goal**: Users can quickly grasp the essence of their sessions through AI-generated summaries and efficiently find specific content using keyword search.

**Depends on**: Phase 1

**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:

- [x] 02-01: Database & Background Job Setup
- [x] 02-02: Search Engine & Text Persistence
- [x] 02-03: AI Summarization Pipeline
- [x] 02-04: Campaign Management & Dashboard
- [x] 02-05: Integrated Features UI

**Details:**

Phase 2 added Campaign model to the database schema, initialized Inngest for background job processing, implemented PostgreSQL full-text search with automatic indexing triggers, integrated Claude 3.5 Sonnet for AI-powered summarization with structured output (Executive Summary, Key NPCs, Items & Loot, Plot Hooks, Notable Quotes), created campaign management system with dashboard, and built search UI with debounced keyword search across transcripts.

Key technical decisions included using Inngest for background jobs to keep the UI responsive during long-running AI operations, PostgreSQL FTS for search (avoiding external dependencies), and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for high-quality narrative summarization.

### Phase 3: Player Engagement & Insights

**Goal**: Users can provide tailored recaps to players and gain basic statistical insight into their game sessions.

**Depends on**: Phase 2

**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:

- [x] 03-01: Metrics & Speaker Foundation
- [x] 03-02: AI Player Recaps
- [x] 03-03: Sharing & Export

**Details:**

Phase 3 extended the database schema with shareToken, playerRecap, speakerNames, and metrics fields, created a metrics parser to extract session statistics (duration, word count, speaker distribution) from AWS Transcribe JSON, implemented speaker statistics UI with in-place renaming functionality, integrated AI player recap generation using Claude 3.5 Sonnet with selective filtering of GM-only information, created public sharing routes with obfuscated tokens, implemented professional PDF export using @react-pdf/renderer, and built export controls for copying text and share links.

Key technical decisions included storing speaker name mappings in a JSON field for flexibility, implementing in-place speaker editing to minimize context switching, using AI reasoning to distinguish player-facing vs GM-only content, and generating obfuscated share tokens for secure public access.

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Use AWS RDS PostgreSQL for database (hosted, managed)
- Auth.js for authentication (industry standard, flexible)
- AWS S3 + Transcribe for audio pipeline (reliable, scalable)
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet for AI summarization (best-in-class narrative understanding)
- Inngest for background jobs (keeps UI responsive during long AI operations)
- PostgreSQL full-text search (no external dependencies, good enough for v1)
- JSON field for speaker mappings (simple, flexible over normalized tables)
- Public sharing with obfuscated tokens (secure, no auth required for players)

**Issues Resolved:**

- AWS RDS connectivity (security group configuration)
- Campaign relation missing from getSessionById (added include)
- Inngest events endpoint missing authentication (added auth + ownership checks)
- Import errors across multiple files (authOptions → authConfig, prisma imports)
- Missing dependencies (date-fns, lucide-react)
- Validation schema missing transcriptText field
- UI button component missing

**Issues Deferred:**

- Phase 1 and Phase 2 VERIFICATION.md files (functionality verified via integration testing, documentation deferred)
- Metrics persistence optimization (metrics calculated on-demand, works fine for v1)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Metrics field defined in schema but never persisted to database (optional optimization for v2)
- Phase verification documents incomplete (process violation but non-blocking)
